## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to know how much a house costs to rent or own in your area? Have you wanted to know how machine learning and statistics work with a powerful programming language like Python?

It is used in machine learning, a major field that lets computers take in data and learn patterns to make predictions and decisions. We will be using Python to learn about one of the fundamentals of predictive modeling in machine learning and, more specifically, linear regression. To help us out, we will use a few data science libraries:

- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Linear Regression


Linear regression is a simple statistical technique used to model the relationship between independent x variables (e.g., house sizes) and a dependent y variable (e.g., house prices) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. We are essentially drawing a straight line through a dataset to map out and predict. In data science, linear regression is widely used for tasks such as predicting sales, analyzing economic trends, and understanding the impact of variables on an outcome.

In this tutorial, we will be using linear regression to predict house prices based on house sizes, where the model learns a linear relationship between these two variables and then makes predictions on the test set, as visualized in the scatter plot.

## Getting Set Up with Anaconda

This tutorial will show you how to use predictive modeling on Anaconda Online. Anaconda Online utilizes integrated Jupyter Notebooks and powerful package management making it super easy to run complex programs including linear regression. 

Begin by accessing Anaconda Online through your web browser, we are eliminating the need for local installations. Sign up for a free account to use the editor.

##Our Tools of Choice

Libraries! Gotta love‚Äôem. In this tutorial, we will be using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn (also known as `sklearn`) . This quad of Python libraries are powerful tools for data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning:

- üî¢ [NumPy](https://numpy.org) offers a robust foundation for numerical operations and data analysis.
- üìñ[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) allows you to analyze, clean, explore, and manipulate data from different sources
- üìà [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) transforms your data into compelling visuals like 2D graphs and barcharts.
- ü§ñ [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), commonly known as Sklearn, provides a user-friendly interface for all kinds of machine learning.

If you ever wondered how ‚Äúprediction‚Äù charts are created in Python, the odds are that 1 of these 4 tools was involved. This quad of tools is the base for data analysis and machine learning which makes it easy for beginners to unlock the power of Python in data science.

After launching Notebook on Anaconda, open a new project:

##Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will be using a data set that compares house size and house prices of properties sold in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood to predict the cost of houses based on size. 

To get started, let‚Äôs import the libraries. Remember that since you are using an online emulator there is no need for local installations. This is a simple setup for linear regression using the scikit-learn library.

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
Here is a quick refresher on libraries and what they do:

`numpy` is used for numerical operations.
`pandas` is used to read and analyze data.
`matplotlib.pyplot` is used for plotting graphs.
`train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` is used for splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
`LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` is the class that implements linear regression.

Next, let‚Äôs import some data. All data was gathered from Zillow recently sold. You will need to download the data set and upload it to Anaconda.

```
#Load data from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('home_dataset.csv')
 
#Extract features and target variable
house_sizes = data ['HouseSize'].values
house_prizes = data['HousePrice'].values
```

We are using `pd.read_csv` to read the CSV file containing 59 pairs of data points. Next, we are extracting the values corresponding to the features on the data sheet. In this case, the data from the column named ‚ÄúHouseSize‚Äù is being added to the variable ‚Äòhouse_size‚Äô.

Let's now get started on plotting the data, via the `plt` object from Matplotlib. First, we use `plt.scatter()` to create a scatter plot of house prices vs. house size. Next, we assign a title and x- and y-axis labels before using `plt.show()` to display the graph.

```
#Visualize the data
plt.scatter(house_sizes, house_prices, marker ='o', color ='blue')
plt.title('House Prices vs. House Size')
plt.xlabel('House Size (sq.ft)')
plt.ylabel('House Price ($)')
plt.show()

```
##Train test

Now that we have extracted our data and plotted on a graph, it's time for the linear regression part.

A train-test splits the generated data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function from Sklearn.

The train test split is a model validation procedure commonly used in predictive machine learning to simulate how a model will work with new/unknown data. It is commonly used with large data sets or when you need a quick estimate.
