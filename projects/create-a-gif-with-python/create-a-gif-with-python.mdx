## Introduction

Do you pronounce it “GIF” or a “JIF”? Either way, [Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) is great for creating animated images. The format has been around since 1987 and helped define the early internet. It’s used to display memes, graphics, logos, and they are everywhere — on websites, blogs, texts, and social media.

GIFs are “animated images” because they aren’t exactly videos. They are more like flipbooks; they don’t have sound and flip through multiple pictures sequentially.

In this project tutorial, I will show you how to combine multiple images and create a GIF using just 6 lines of Python code! More specifically, a list, a `for` loop, and a Python library called `imageio`.

Here’s a preview of the project:

## ImageIO Library

[Imageio](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data. It runs on Python 3.5+.

Suppose you have Python and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) the package installer on your computer. In that case, you can install `imageio` using this command in the **Terminal** (Mac) or **Command Prompt** (Windows):

```sh
pip install imageio
```

Press <kbd>enter</kbd>, and this message should appear:

```sh
Successfully installed imageio-2.19.3
```

You can quickly check if the `imageio` package was successfully installed by opening **Python IDLE** and running the command `import imageio`. If no errors appear, then you are good to go!

## Writing the Program

Let’s open up a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

To use the `imageio` library, you need to include it in your code. The "v3" in the import statement means you're using version 3 of the `imageio` library:

```py
import imageio.v3 as iio
```

The `as iio` part allows you to give the library a shorter name to work with, making it more convenient. Now, run the code to make sure it works!

Here are two images that you can use for this project (feel free to use your own!):

- [team-pic1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/create-a-gif-with-python/team-pic1.png)
- [team-pic2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/create-a-gif-with-python/team-pic2.png)

Make sure to store the image files in the same folder as the one that contains your Python program file.

In our Python program, we'll create a list that contains the locations of the image files. We also need to create an empty list that will be used to store the actual image data from these files.

```py
filenames = ['team-pic1.png', 'team-pic2.png']
images = [ ]
```

Next, let’s use a `for` loop to go through the file paths and read the images using `imageio` library’s `.imread()` method:

```py
for filename in filenames:
  images.append(iio.imread(filename))
```

The `.imread()` method loads an image based on the file path. So now, our `images` variable has all the images!

Lastly, let’s use the `.imwrite()` method to turn the images into a GIF:

```py
iio.imwrite('team.gif', images, duration = 500, loop = 0)
```

This takes in four arguments:

- `'team.gif'`: This is the name you want to give to your new GIF file.
- `images`: The list containing the image data.
- `duration = 500`: How long each picture should show in the GIF, in milliseconds.
- `loop = 0`: How many times the GIF should repeat (0 means it keeps looping forever).

And that’s it! Here’s the whole program:

```py
import imageio.v3 as iio

filenames = ['team-pic1.png', 'team-pic2.png']
images = [ ]

for filename in filenames:
  images.append(iio.imread(filename))

iio.imwrite('team.gif', images, duration = 500, loop = 0)
```

Let’s run this program and see what happens! A new `team.gif` appeared:

## Wrapping Up

Congrats! You created a GIF in just 6 lines of code. Now you don’t have to rely on paid online tools to sew your images into GIFs. You just need a list, a `for` loop, and the `imageio` library to do the trick.
