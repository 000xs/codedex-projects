**Prerequisites:** Python fundamentals  
**Versions:** Python 3.10, Pillow 9.2.0, qrcode 7.3.1 <br />
**Read Time:** 30 minutes <br />


## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how [QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) work or how procedural images are generated? Have you ever wanted to send someone a link in a much cooler way? If you said yes to any of these questions, you're in luck! 

In this quick tutorial, we will learn how to create a QR code in Python with [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode) and [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow) with only five lines of code. 

Let's jump in!


## What is a QR Code? 

A QR code, or a Quick Response code, is a 2D barcode containing black patterns on a white background. However, this is no ordinary scribble: QR codes are capable of storing huge amounts of data in a deceivingly small amount of space. These black rectangles can store links, text, basically anything you want... and can be accessed simply by scanning from any mobile device! 

A QR code is important since it gives users a simple way to access something on a non-conventional source (e.g. on a piece of paper). For example, putting your QR code on a piece of paper is way better than putting the link on paper. QR codes are now being used on restaurant menus, business cards, and even superbowl ads!


## Setting Up

First, go to the Python code editor of your choice (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), then create and open a new file called `createqrcode.py`. This is where we will be writing our code.

**Note:** You can call your file any name except `qrcode.py`. This is because `qrcode.py` is a file that already exists as part of the `qrcode` library, and calling your file `qrcode.py` will overwrite the library functions. 

To start, we need to install two libraries. 

We first need to install the `qrcode` library. This library lets us perform all of our QR code related operations. 

We also need to install the `pillow` library. The pillow library is a great library (that you will see in other projects as well) that helps us process and save images. 

In your VS Code terminal, run this command: 

```bash
pip install qrcode pillow
```

After this, we can import our two libraries. Add this line of code (`pillow` is implicitly imported). 

```py
import qrcode
```

This makes sure that the two libraries can be used in the rest of our code, since Python code runs from top to bottom in a file.


## Creating the QR Code

First, we want a link that we want to showcase. For this tutorial, we will use the Codédex website, https://codedex.io.

We can take in this link as input: 

```py
link_to_qrcode = "https://codedex.io"
```

Next, we want to create an instance of qrcode. Since qrcode is a Python library, we can call the package constructor to create an qrcode object, customized to our specifications. In this example, we will create a QR code with a version of 1, and a box size and border size of 5. 

The `version` parameter is an integer from 1 to 40 that controls the size of the QR code.
The `box_size` parameter controls how many pixels each “box” of the QR code is. The `border` parameter controls how many boxes thick the border should be.

```py
qr = qrcode.QRCode(version = 1, box_size = 5, border = 5)
```

As an exercise, try taking in these parameters as input, and explaining to the user how to set this up, so they can create the QR code to their own specifications. 

Visit [documentation](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) for more information about the parameters in `qrcode.QRCode(...)`. 

Then, the data (specifically, the link we specified before) is added to the QR code, using `.add_data()`. The QR code is then generated using `.make()`

```py
qr.add_data(link_to_qrcode)
qr.make()
```

Finally, we save this created QR code in an `img` pillow object using `qr.make_image()`. We set the line color `fill_color` to black, and the background color `back_color` to white. 

```py
img = qr.make_image(fill_color = "black", back_color = "white")
```

Finally, we have to store and save the file. We can do this using pillow's `save()` command. We specify the file name inside the brackets, which is `codedex_qr.png` in our case. 


```py
img.save('codedex_qr.png')
```

Now we are done! 

Here’s the whole code:

```py
import qrcode

link_to_qrcode = input("Please enter the link you want to change into a QRCode: ")

qr = qrcode.QRCode(version = 1, box_size = 5, border = 5)
qr.add_data(link_to_qrcode)
qr.make()

img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
img.save('codedex_qr.png')
```

You should see the `codedex.png` image pop up on the left hand side of VS Code, and you can open it to see what it looks like. 

You can add this QR code to anywhere you like, including your website or portfolio! 

## Improvements

To improve this, we could do a couple of things: 

- Allow the link of the qrcode to be taken in as input
- Automate the process to create multiple QR codes (or allow users to customize the qrcode generated)
- Include more functions (or object parameters) of the `qrcode` library: https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/
- Try changing the colors and styles of the generated QR codes using different drawer modules and fill colors
- Use a application library (like [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)) to add a user interface
- Check out other QR code libraries like `pyqrcode`
