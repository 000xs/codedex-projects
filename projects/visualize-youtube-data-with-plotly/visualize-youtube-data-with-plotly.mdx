**Prerequisites:** Python fundamentals, Microsoft Excel  
**Versions:** Python 3.10, Plotly 5.9  
**Time:** 1 Hour  


## [#](#-introduction) Introduction

So you want to learn about making data visualizations, huh? Well, you’re in the right spot! 

Data visualization is translating data into a visual representation to make it easier on the human eye. It makes communication of complex ideas more effective, quick and easy to follow. It is super important as it makes data more accessible and digestible.

[Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express) makes it easy to begin learning this process. Plotly Express is an easy-to-use, high level module that makes visualizing data simple. Plotly was actually the first library I used when I started my journey in data!

In this tutorial, we will be creating data visualizations of YouTube data using Python and Plotly Express. We will be looking at subscriber counts, types of video categories, and the different years creators start YouTubing. 

Let’s get into it (yuh)!


## [#](#-50-ideas) Setting Up

First, visit [colab.research.google.com](https://research.google.com/colaboratory) and start a new notebook. 

After that, make sure you have the latest version of Python on your machine. You can check this by typing `$ python --version` in Windows command prompt or the terminal on Mac and Linux. At the time this article was written, you should be running Python version 3.10. 

Once you have checked this, pull up the [Plotly Express docs page](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express). It will come in handy while working. Finally, download the dataset used for this tutorial from down below. It would not be a data visualization without your data, obviously!

### About Our Data

For this tutorial, we will be using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). You can [download it here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/top-youtube-channels-data)! It contains data about the top YouTube channels. There are seven columns in this dataset. Lucky us! 

The columns are as follows:

- `rank`: Rank of the channel as per number of subscribers they have
- `youtuber`: Channel name
- `subscribers`: Number of subscribers
- `video views`: Number for which all videos have been watched collectively
- `video count`: Number of videos uploaded
- `category`: Channel genre
- `started`: Year when the channel was started

We have made acquaintance with our dataset. Now, let’s jump into some visualizations!


### [##](##-level-1) Importing Your Data

First things first (I’m the realest), we are going to import our data into our notebook. After downloading your dataset, you should return to your handy dandy Google Colab notebook. Once you make it back, go ahead and input `from google.colab import files`. After that, type in `uploaded=files.upload()`. You will be prompted to upload files from your computer. Look in your local drive for the dataset and upload the file. 

You should have something like this!

After that, you will need to do `import io`. Doing this will let us import our data into a dataframe and work with file related input/output operations.

### [##](##-level-2) Importing Pandas and Declaring Our Dataframe

Pandas is the most widely used open source Python package to perform data analytics. After importing io, we will `import pandas as pd`. pd serves as the alias for referring to the pandas package in our program. 

Once you have done that, we need to create a pandas dataframe. A pandas dataframe stores the data as a 2-dimensional table in Python. As analysts, we want to be quick creating the graphs, so we can take our time analyzing and reporting our findings. Therefore, we have to create a dataframe to structure our data and easily report findings by converting them to a visualization. You can use any shorthand name for the dataframe variable, but for this example we will use `df2`. `df2` variable will store the dataframe returned from the `pd.read_excel()` method. To do that, you would put in `df2=pd.read_excel(io.BytesIO(uploaded['YouTube Data.xlsx']))`.

You should have the following after completing the steps above:

## [#](#-50-ideas) Section 1: Make a Histogram

For this exercise, we are going to be looking at two different graphs: a histogram to look at subscriber count and a pie chart to analyze video categories.

Let’s kick things off with our histogram.

Normally, others will import their library during setup. However, I like to have my imports and graph code together. Therefore, we are going to input `import plotly express as px`. `px` will serve as the alias we will use in this portion of the process. After you have imported Plotly Express, we will be ready to start on our histogram!

```python
import plotly.express as px
```

Creating a histogram in Plotly Express is so easy. You know how we create them? Drum roll please…

```python
fig = px.histogram(df2, x="subscribers\xa0")
```

Alright, let’s break this down. First, we need to declare to variable `fig`. `fig` will allow us to work with the Plotly Express library. Remember `px` from earlier? We use it to let our notebook what type of graph we want shown. For example, we typed out px.histogram because we needed a histogram. Inside the parentheses, we have our dataframe (df2) and our x value we want to display. We are looking at subscriber count in this exercise.

After we do this, we will use `fig.show`, and you should see something like this!

## [#](#-50-ideas) Make a Pie Chart!

We are going to do the same thing we did before, but this time we are going to create a pie chart. For this pie chart, we are going to analyze the different video categories the top channel belong to.

All we need to do is replace `fig = px.histogram(df, x="total_bill")` with `fig=px.pie(df2, values='subscribers\xa0', names='category\xa0', title="YouTube Categories")`. We have the same situation where we declare our dataframe. However, this time we need to declare our values and names. For this part, you would use the variable with numeric values for the values variable and a string for the names variable. Finally, you need to name your graph. Obviously! You can choose whatever name you want here, but for the sake of this example, we will call our graph “YouTube Categories”. 

You should end up with something like this!

## [#](#-50-ideas) Wrapping Up

Congrats, you just created a data visualization analyzing the top dogs on YouTube! Many people assume data visualization is such a complex thing, but it can be as easy as running a few lines of code. One piece of advice I would give to you is to practice using one type of library for your first year of learning how to do visualizations. It will give you the opportunity to get the hang of things and learn about your preferences.
