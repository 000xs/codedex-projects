## Content Guidelines

To ensure the quality of our project tutorials, all tutorials must abide with these content guidelines: 

-  Your project tutorial topic must be the one agreed upon in your issue
- All the content you create is your own work, and not plagiarized from other sources
- All code created is adequately commented or explained
- Your project tutorial should correctly render in `mdx`

Our projects are divided into three difficulties:

- Beginner: Projects that are for code newbies. These projects should be easy to understand even for new programmers.  
- Intermediate: Projects that are for less experienced programmers. These projects should contain some more difficult concepts, but should still be understandable by most programmers. 
- Advanced: Projects that are for experienced programmers. Projects can contain advanced concepts and paradigms.

If a project tutorial does not follow these guidelines, we will request changes in order for the tutorial to meet these guidelines. If you do not comply, the PR will be marked as invalid and closed.
