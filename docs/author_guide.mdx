üí≠ Voice & Tone

While we encourage you to infuse your personality/voice, below are guidelines in how we think about our voice & tone when speaking with or explaining a concept to our community members.

Voice: We want to establish ourselves as coding experts in a supportive community where our users can lean on us. We are honest, non-judgmental, and accessible in our messaging and know-how. 


We are motivating, fun, and inspiring people. We believe in a future where everyone can learn technical skills in a way that isn‚Äôt dry.

We want to be easily understood, avoiding programming jargon that may isolate members of our community. Communicate simply, cue The Feynman Technique. Use humor, when relevant, and a mix of casual and professional language when teaching a topic.
