# Content Guidelines

To ensure the quality of our project tutorials, they must abide by these content guidelines: 

- Your project tutorial topic must be the one agreed upon in your issue.
- All the content you create is your own work, and not plagiarized from other sources.
- All code created is adequately commented or explained.
- Your project tutorial should correctly render in MDX.
- Your tutorial content follows the [project template](https://github.com/codedex-io/projects/blob/main/docs/project_template.mdx), and includes the necessary metadata within the first 32 lines.
- Each project should have a full complete project solution code in a code block towards the bottom of the project. The name of the file should be in a comment on line 1. If there are multiple files, there should be multiple code blocks.

## Formatting

- Subheadings are in "Title Case": Setting Up
- Folder and file names are bolded: **hello_world.py**
- Function names use parentheses: `print()`
- Method names use the dot operator: `.insert()`
- Python strings should use single quotes: `' '`.
- Indentation should be two spaces.

## Image Sizes

- Card image on the Projects page: 220x170 ([example](https://www.codedex.io/images/projects/card_images/generate-a-blog-with-openai.png))
- Project header image: 1000x350 ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/generate-a-blog-with-openai/header.png))
- Project SEO image: 1200x630 ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/generate-a-blog-with-openai/seo.png))

If a project tutorial does not follow these guidelines, we will request changes in order for the tutorial to meet these guidelines. If you do not comply (or if changes are not made within 1 month), the PR will be marked as invalid and closed.

### Difficulties

Our projects are divided into three difficulties:

- `beginner`: Projects for code newbies and people who have just finished "The Legend of Python" course.
- `intermediate`: Projects that are for less experienced programmers. These projects should contain some more difficult concepts, but should still be understandable by most programmers. 
- `advanced`: Projects that are for experienced programmers. Projects can contain advanced concepts and paradigms.
